## Best Practices

### Do:
- ✓ Keep follow-ups brief (3-4 paragraphs max)
- ✓ Reference specific details from your interactions
- ✓ Express genuine interest, not just generic enthusiasm
- ✓ Make it easy for them to respond (clear ask, specific question)
- ✓ Proofread carefully
- ✓ Send during business hours (9am-5pm their timezone, mid-week best)

### Don't:
- ✗ Follow up too frequently (respect the timelines above)
- ✗ Express frustration or impatience
- ✗ Mention other opportunities to create pressure
- ✗ Write long emails with your entire life story
- ✗ Use all caps, excessive exclamation points, or overly casual language
- ✗ Send more than 2 follow-ups without response

## Customization Process

When drafting a follow-up email:

1. **Select appropriate template** based on stage and timing
2. **Gather context:**
   - User's name and contact info
   - Company and position details
   - Date of last interaction
   - Specific topics discussed (if applicable)
   - User's relevant experience to mention
3. **Customize template:**
   - Replace all [bracketed placeholders]
   - Add specific details from user's situation
   - Adjust tone if needed based on company culture
4. **Save draft** in application folder as `follow-up-draft-[YYYY-MM-DD].txt`
5. **Present to user** for review before sending

## Email Subject Line Formulas

Keep subject lines clear and searchable:

**Good subject lines:**
- "Following up on [Position] application"
- "Thank you - [Position] interview"
- "Checking in - [Position] timeline"
- "[Your Name] - [Position] application"

**Bad subject lines:**
- "Quick question" (too vague)
- "Following up!!!" (unprofessional)
- "Still waiting to hear back..." (passive-aggressive)
- Empty subject line (looks like spam)

## Cultural Considerations

Adjust tone based on company culture:

**Corporate/Traditional (Finance, Law, Healthcare):**
- More formal language
- Longer wait times between follow-ups
- Professional email signatures with credentials

**Tech/Startup:**
- Slightly more casual tone acceptable
- Can follow up a bit sooner
- Show technical knowledge/enthusiasm

**Creative (Design, Marketing, Media):**
- Can show more personality
- Visual email formatting acceptable
- Demonstrate creativity in approach

## Special Scenarios

### Recruiter vs. Hiring Manager
- **Recruiter:** More administrative, can follow up sooner
- **Hiring Manager:** Decision-maker, be more respectful of their time

### Internal Referral
- Mention referrer early and prominently
- Can be slightly more casual
- Follow up sooner (they expect it)

### Job Fair/Networking Event
- Reference where you met specifically
- Follow up within 2-3 days
- Attach resume even if you already gave them one

### Cold Application (No Response)
- One follow-up after 7-10 days
- Keep it very brief
- Accept that no response often means no

## Tracking Follow-Ups

In the job tracker spreadsheet, record:
- Date of each follow-up sent
- Type of follow-up (Thank you, Timeline check, etc.)
- Response received (Yes/No)
- Next action date

This prevents over-following-up and helps you maintain professional communication patterns.
