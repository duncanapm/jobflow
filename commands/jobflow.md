## Getting Started

First, let me understand your needs:

1. **What is your location preference?** (UK, US, remote, specific cities)
   - This is critical for filtering relevant jobs only

2. **What types of roles are you targeting?** (job titles, seniority level, industry)

3. **Do you have a base resume/CV?** (needed for tailoring suggestions)

4. **Where should I create your tracking system?** (I'll suggest `~/job-search`)

5. **Any other preferences?** (salary range, remote/hybrid/onsite, company size)
