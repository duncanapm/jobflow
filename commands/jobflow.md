## Getting Started

Just two questions:

1. **What country are you in?**
2. **Give me one job title to start with.**

I'll immediately show you 5 matching jobs. Then you tell me how to refine — by market segment, company stage, location, salary, or anything else.

```
Example:
  You: UK, Senior Sales Engineer
  → I show 5 matching roles
  You: Focus on AI Observability companies, pre-IPO
  → I show 5 refined matches
  You: Tell me more about Arize AI
  → I dig into that company and role
  You: I want to apply to that one
  → I set up tracking and help you tailor your application
```
