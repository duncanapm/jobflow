# JobFlow Command

JobFlow v1.1.0 loaded - let's organize your job search!

Load the `jobflow` skill and help the user with their job search workflow. Ask the initial questions from the Quick Start Workflow:

1. What is your location preference? (UK, US, remote, specific cities - critical for filtering relevant jobs)
2. What types of roles are you looking for? (job titles, seniority level, industry)
3. Do you have a base resume/CV? (needed for tailoring suggestions)
4. Where should I create the tracking spreadsheet and application folders? (suggest a dedicated job-search folder)
5. Any other preferences? (salary range, remote/hybrid/onsite, company size)

Then help them set up their job search system following the JobFlow skill guidelines.
