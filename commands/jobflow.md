## Getting Started

Just two questions:

1. **What country are you in?**
2. **Give me one job title to start with.**

I'll immediately show you 5 matching jobs. Then you tell me how to refine — by market segment, company stage, location, salary, or anything else.

```
Example:
  You: UK, Senior Sales Engineer
  → I show 5 matching roles with quick triage
  You: 1,3 interested, rest pass — too enterprise. Focus on AI Observability, pre-IPO
  → I note your preferences, show 5 refined matches
  You: 1 and 2 apply, 3 interested, pass on 4,5 — too early stage
  → I set up applications for your picks, shortlist the maybe, refine for next round
```
